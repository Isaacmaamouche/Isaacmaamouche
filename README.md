Hyperactive looking for new challenges ðŸ”¥ 
I grew a passion for development thanks to an opportunity.
Becoming a web project manager, 
I worked with fascinating developers, 
I was the behind the scenes", 
I made a lot of grey hairs. 
But I also discovered the sea of possibility offered by code. 
And as always, my curiosity made me explore that sea, 
and I can't wait to live this new adventure.
